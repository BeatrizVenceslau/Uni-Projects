#### Rationale
These end-to-end tests target common operations the majority of users (i.e. teachers, in this context) would perform.
As the name implies, they check everything from the front-end to the back-end of the product/service being developed.

There is one case where an error is expected. Because the "Default Correct Answer" is mandatory, some users may try to "game"
the system by filling that field with spaces/newlines/etc. We want to make sure that these attempts are handled correctly.

We also have a test to change the default correct answer, as we feel this is something users would do frequently.

#### Rationale
End-to-End tests are defined for the common use cases to test the code from beginning to end, to check that the code runs as expected, making sure that the subsystems work well together, since a problem in one could mean the whole system fails.
The tests are made from the point of view of the user to simulate a real scenario of a person using the final product.
End-to-End testing brings benefits since it reduces the number of bugs present in the code and ensures the code runs correctly.
